# This model is from the original GitHub address: https://github.com/arbellea/LSTM-UNet
  Follow the guidance on it


# It is necessary to install or update the version of tools in the "requirements.txt" - This work has been done.


# Data (original dataset we downloaded) is located in the folder name "CellTrackingChallenge"

        path: home/linux/LSTM-UNet/CellTrackingChallenge/Training/PhC-C2DH-U373_training dataset/...
              home/linux/LSTM-UNet/CellTrackingChallenge/Testing/PhC-C2DH-U373/...


# The path directory should be modified when you save the updated location of each dataset.
# Open the Params.py file and change the paths for ROOT_DATA_DIR and ROOT_SAVE_DIR. ROOT_DATA_DIR should point to the directory of the cell tracking challenge training data: /Training and ROOT_SAVE_DIR should point to whichever directory you would like to save the checkpoints and tensorboard logs.

  Check the Files: 1. DataHandeling.py
                   2. Params.py



# Run the code on Terminal: 
  1. source ~/my_lstm_unet_env/bin/activate [Go to the virtual environment for requirements] or you can make your own space.
  2. python3 train2D.py


# Result
  We can see lots of errors. The mask data from the given dataset is problematic and shows all black, not segmented images.
  This has to be solved to move to the next step.
