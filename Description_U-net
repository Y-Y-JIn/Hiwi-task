# This simple U-net model is built for automatic segmentation of random nano-plastic images.


# All required files are located in the folder "U-net"  
  Path: "/home/nemolinux/Python/sam2/notebooks/Machine Learning model/Model_segmentation/U-net

  Required files:
  - U-net_final_v2
  - inference_v2
  - Implementation of U-net model



# Process
1. Run the "U-net_final_v2" 
  - modify the file that you want to try to segment and the corresponding path directory for loading image and saving the result.

2. Run the "Inference_v2"
  - Load the trained model with the path directory.

3. Run the "Implementation of U-net model"
  - Input a new image to the model and check the result in your path directory.



# Result
Something is wrong with the colorization, I only can see the single-color-filled image. The issue is not solved.
